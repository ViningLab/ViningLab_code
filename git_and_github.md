## Forks and branches

A fork, or forked repositiry, is attched to a GitHub account.
A branch is a part of a repository.
If you want to make edits to a repository where your account lacks permission, you should make a fork so that your account has a forked copy.
If you have a repository where you woule like to propose changes it is best to create a branch so that your changes can be compared to the main branch prior to merging your proposals.
